# Monthly Pattern Extraction of Hourly Values

### This script uses the output of the [Join Multiple Databases](http://example.org/) script.

## Problem
You have several monthly databases comprised of two vector columns.
- One of **hours** from 1-24 that repeats n times, where n is the days of the month.
- And one of a **target value** corresponding to each hour.
However, you need the target value's daily average pattern for each month.

## Objective
To generate a monthly pattern of hourly values.

## Methods
### Python:
Patterns are calculated using normalized points from the daily averages of the values per month.
- Libraries used:
  - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/install/)
  - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/install.html)
### MATLAB:
Patterns are generated by doing polynomial regression fit curves using sum of sines. Specifically, MATLAB's *fit* function with the *sin8* parameter. Then, the resulting expression is evaluated from 1 to 24 (hours in a day).
- Package used: [Curve Fitting Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/curvefitting.html)

## Applications
To gain insight through patterns. Can be applied to:
- Monetary values: Costs, profit, etc.
- Consumer demands
- Physical property values
- Anything that can be tracked hourly in a monthly basis.

## How to use
- Install the corresponding libraries/packages mentioned above for each method.
- Adapt the code to your specific use case by changing file directories and attributes.
- Uncomment snips as needed.
